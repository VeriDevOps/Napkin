This directory (gaeditorweb2.1/client/js-batch) contains those files from
../js which are necessary to run GA evaluation in batch, that is, without
a browser or server.

============================================================
A number of modifications were necessary for running in Node.js:

Node.js does not have 'import', so 'require' is used instead.

Export is done in a different way.

Util.isValidFunction worked by looking at a variable containing all
names from Operator, constructed by 'import'. Now use an explicit list.

When Util required Operators and vice versa, the code in Operators thought
that Util.xxx were undefined.
Removed the require of Operators from Util.

EventBus is in principle unnecessary, but since it keeps the signal
data structure, changes in other places could be minimal when it is
kept. It does not do any socket or actual bus management.

SignalList.loadSignals was copied to EventBus, as well as updateXmax.

The language construct
    for ([key, value] ...
needed key and value to be declared first.
